 What I'm really how bruising an encounter was that? It was a tough game, especially when you're down to 10 men. But I thought we played some decent stuff, first half we were very poor. But we knew that if we improved on our performance we'd get chances and hopefully score goals like we did in the second half. It looked like you and Patrick Vierre were trading insults and threats in the tunnel beforehand. What happened? I don't want to go into too much detail, but Patrick Vierre is 6'4", so I said I want to go on Gary Neville. Is this coming over to me? Simple as that. Do you feel battle lines were drawn before you even went on the pitch? Well if players wanted to limit it to someone my teammates then let's have a go with somebody other players. Do you think Gary Neville is an easy target? But I'm not having it. What about on the pitch itself? In some quarters, Manchester City were criticised for their physical approach at Old Trafford. Do you feel you really want to play really good football tonight? I think so. I think especially in the second half, even when we don't determine we kept the ball moving. I think if Michael Admin sent off we could score a few more. But you've got to win tackles and it's a physical game. I think fans enjoy that as much as scoring. So you know, if teams are going to give it all they've got to accept it.
